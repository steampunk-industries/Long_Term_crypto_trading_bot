# AWS Deployment Summary for Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

## Deployment Status

The deployment of your Cryptocurrency Trading Bot to AWS has been successfully initiated! The CloudFormation stack `crypto-trading-app-simple` is now being created and should complete in approximately 15-20 minutes.

## Resources Being Deployed

The simplified CloudFormation template includes the following resources:

1. **EC2 Instance** - A t3.medium instance running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
2. **RDS Database** - A PostgreSQL database for storing trading data
3. **Security Groups** - For controlling access to your EC2 and RDS instances
4. **IAM Roles** - With proper permissions for ECR access and instance management
5. **Subnet Group** - For proper RDS deployment across multiple availability zones

## Access Credentials

Once deployment is complete, you can access your trading dashboard at:
- URL: `https://steampunk.holdings`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Pizza&Pandas23`
- API Key: `02d4381bf17c3301d0842531bd39dcbe`

## Deployment Challenges and Solutions

During the deployment process, we encountered and resolved several issues:

1. **YAML Syntax Errors**
   - Issue: The original CloudFormation template contained syntax errors with intrinsic functions like `!If` and `!FindInMap`
   - Solution: Fixed function syntax by adding required commas between parameters

2. **Missing Conditions**
   - Issue: References to conditions that weren't properly defined
   - Solution: Added proper `Conditions` section with `IsProduction` condition

3. **Missing RegionMap**
   - Issue: References to a mapping that wasn't defined
   - Solution: Added proper `Mappings` section with AMI IDs for different regions

4. **Parameter Handling**
   - Issue: Required parameters weren't being passed correctly
   - Solution: Updated deployment script to properly extract ECR repository URI

5. **Lambda Function Issues**
   - Issue: Custom resources with Lambda functions were causing deployment failures
   - Solution: Simplified template to use direct resource references instead of custom resources

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Stack Creation**
   - Check the AWS CloudFormation console to monitor deployment progress
   - Expected completion time: ~20 minutes

2. **Set Up DNS**
   - Update your DNS records to point your domain to the EC2 instance's public IP
   - After deployment, you can get the IP using:
     ```
     aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:aws:cloudformation:stack-name,Values=crypto-trading-app-simple" --query "Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress" --output text
     ```

3. **Configure Trading Strategies**
   - Log in to the dashboard and configure your trading strategies
   - Upload any custom strategies you've developed

4. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Configure CloudWatch Alarms for important metrics
   - Set up notifications for trade execution and system status

## Maintenance Instructions

1. **Database Backups**
   - RDS automatic backups are enabled with a 7-day retention period
   - For additional backups, you can use the AWS CLI or Console

2. **System Updates**
   - SSH into your EC2 instance using your key pair: `ssh -i /path/to/Trading_App_PairKey1.pem ubuntu@<EC2-IP-ADDRESS>`
   - Run system updates: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

3. **Deployment Updates**
   - For future updates, you can use the same CloudFormation stack with the update-stack command
   - `aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name crypto-trading-app-simple --template-body file://aws-cloudformation-simplified.yml --parameters ...`
