## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL (optional, SQLite is used by default)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Long_Term_crypto_trading_bot.git
   cd Long_Term_crypto_trading_bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file:
   ```
   # Exchange API Keys (Replace with your own keys)
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
   BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret
   # ... other configuration options
   ```

## Usage

The bot can be run in different modes:

### Trading Bot Only

```bash
python -m src.main bot --interval 60
```

This will run the trading bot with a 60-minute interval between runs.

### Dashboard Only

```bash
python -m src.main dashboard
```

This will start the web dashboard on the configured host and port (default: http://0.0.0.0:5000).

### Both Trading Bot and Dashboard

```bash
python -m src.main both --interval 60
```

This will run both the trading bot and the dashboard simultaneously.

### Run Once

```bash
python -m src.main bot --once
```

This will run the trading bot once and then exit.

## Dashboard

The web dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your trading bot's performance:

- **Login**: Access the dashboard with your configured username and password
- **Overview**: See portfolio value, PnL, drawdown, and trading mode
- **Portfolio**: View portfolio performance charts and balance distribution
- **Trades**: Analyze executed trades and statistics
- **Signals**: Review trading signals generated by strategies
- **Settings**: Configure bot parameters

## Adding Custom Strategies

To add a custom strategy:

1. Create a new file in the `src/strategies` directory
2. Implement a class that inherits from `BaseStrategy`
3. Override the `generate_signals` method
4. Add your strategy to the `StrategyFactory` class

Example:

```python
from src.strategies.base_strategy import BaseStrategy

class MyCustomStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # Implement your strategy logic here
        return signal_type, confidence, metadata
```

## Configuration

The bot is highly configurable through the `.env` file. Key configuration options include:

- Exchange API keys
- Trading parameters (symbol, initial capital)
- Risk parameters (stop loss, leverage)
- Database settings
- Dashboard credentials

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set up a proper database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. Configure secure API keys with restricted permissions
3. Set up proper logging
4. Consider using a process manager like Supervisor or PM2
5. Set up SSL for the dashboard
