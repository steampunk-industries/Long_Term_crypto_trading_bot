## Prerequisites

Before deploying the trading bot, ensure you have:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Exchange API keys with trading permissions
- At least 8GB RAM available for running the full stack
- Git for version control
- A server with 24/7 uptime (for production)

## Strategy Overview

The system now includes several strategies optimized for different market conditions:

| Strategy | Best Market Conditions | Risk Level | Expected Return | Max Drawdown |
|----------|------------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Low Risk | Sideways, low volatility | Low | 2-5% monthly | 5-10% |
| Medium Risk | Trending with pullbacks | Medium | 5-10% monthly | 10-15% |
| High Risk | Strong trends | High | 10-20% monthly | 15-25% |
| Adaptive Mean Reversion | All conditions (adaptive) | Variable | 5-15% monthly | 10-15% |

The **Adaptive Mean Reversion** strategy is recommended for most users as it:
- Dynamically adjusts parameters based on market volatility
- Performs well across different market regimes
- Implements proper risk management with take profit and stop loss
- Uses adaptive position sizing based on account balance

## Deployment Process

### 1. Local Development Deployment

For testing and development:

```bash
# Clone repository if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto_trading_bot.git
cd crypto_trading_bot

# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and edit environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your exchange API keys and preferences

# Validate strategy performance before deployment
python scripts/validate_strategy_performance.py --strategy adaptive_mean_reversion

# Deploy using the script
chmod +x scripts/deploy_microservices.sh
./scripts/deploy_microservices.sh
```

This will start all services locally with Docker Compose, accessible at:
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8000
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5000
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- RabbitMQ Management: http://localhost:15672

### 2. Production Deployment

For a production environment:

```bash
# On your production server
mkdir -p ~/crypto_trading
cd ~/crypto_trading

# Copy the docker-compose-microservices.yml and .env files
# (Use SCP or similar tool from your development machine)

# Deploy using the script
chmod +x scripts/deploy_microservices.sh
./scripts/deploy_microservices.sh --env production --push --remote
```

### 3. CI/CD Deployment

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment:

1. Push changes to the `develop` branch for automatic deployment to staging
2. Push changes to the `main` branch for automatic deployment to production
3. Use the GitHub Actions UI to manually trigger deployments

## Configuration for Profitability

To maximize profitability, configure the following parameters:

### Exchange Settings in .env file

```
# Exchange API credentials
EXCHANGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
EXCHANGE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Exchange trading settings
EXCHANGE_NAME=binance
DEFAULT_SYMBOLS=BTC/USDT,ETH/USDT
TRADING_MODE=live  # or paper for paper trading
```

### Strategy-Specific Configuration

Edit these parameters in the appropriate strategy file or through the API:

#### Adaptive Mean Reversion (.env or API)

```
# Adaptive Mean Reversion Strategy Parameters
AMR_BASE_LOOKBACK_PERIOD=20
AMR_BASE_STD_DEV_MULTIPLIER=2.0
AMR_POSITION_SIZE_PCT=0.1
AMR_MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=3
AMR_PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=0.03
AMR_STOP_LOSS_PCT=0.02
```

### Recommended Parameters by Market Cap

| Coin Market Cap | Position Size | Lookback Period | Std Dev Multiplier | Profit Target | Stop Loss |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Large (BTC, ETH) | 5-10% | 20-24 | 2.0-2.2 | 2-3% | 1.5-2% |
| Medium | 3-5% | 15-20 | 2.2-2.5 | 3-4% | 2-2.5% |
| Small | 1-3% | 10-15 | 2.5-3.0 | 4-6% | 3-4% |

### API Configuration

Once the system is running, you can configure strategies via the API:

```bash
# Get API key (first time only)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin_password"}'

# Update strategy parameters
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/trading/parameters" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "strategy": "adaptive_mean_reversion",
    "parameters": {
      "base_lookback_period": 20,
      "base_std_dev_multiplier": 2.0,
      "position_size_pct": 0.1,
      "max_open_positions": 3,
      "profit_target_pct": 0.03,
      "stop_loss_pct": 0.02
    }
  }'
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring

1. **Dashboard** (http://localhost:5000)
   - View active trading pairs
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - See open positions and orders

2. **Grafana** (http://localhost:3000)
   - Default credentials: admin/admin
   - Trading performance dashboards
   - System resource monitoring

3. **API Status Endpoint**
   - `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
   - Check system health

### Performance Metrics to Watch

| Metric | Target | Warning Level | Action Needed |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Win Rate | >55% | <45% | Adjust parameters or switch strategy |
| Sharpe Ratio | >1.0 | <0.7 | Reduce position sizes, adjust parameters |
| Max Drawdown | <15% | >20% | Pause trading, reduce risk |
| Daily Return | 0.2-1% | <0% for 3+ days | Review and validate strategy |

## Optimization Workflow

For continuous improvement:

1. **Regular Validation**
   ```bash
   # Weekly strategy validation
   python scripts/validate_strategy_performance.py --strategy adaptive_mean_reversion
   ```

2. **Parameter Optimization**
   - Run the strategy validation with different parameters
   - Consider market regime when adjusting parameters
   - Use the results to update your configuration

3. **Periodic Retraining** (if using ML models)
   - Retrain models monthly with new market data
   - Adjust model hyperparameters based on recent performance

4. **Market Regime Adaptation**
   - Monitor outputs from the Market Regime Detection module
   - Switch strategies based on detected regime:
     * Bullish Trending → High Risk or Medium Risk
     * Ranging/Sideways → Adaptive Mean Reversion or Low Risk
     * Bearish Trending → Consider reduced position sizes or hedge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Potential Causes | Solution |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| No trades executing | API key permissions, insufficient funds | Check API key permissions, ensure sufficient balance |
| High slippage | Low liquidity, large position sizes | Reduce position sizes, trade more liquid pairs |
| Service crash | Memory issues, dependency problems | Check logs with `docker-compose logs [service]` |
| Connection errors | Network issues, exchange downtime | Implement retry logic, check exchange status |

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose-microservices.yml logs -f trading_adaptive_mean_reversion

# Check all logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose-microservices.yml logs -f

# View just error logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose-microservices.yml logs -f | grep ERROR
```

### Emergency Stop

```bash
# Stop all trading immediately
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/trading/command" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "strategy": "all",
    "command": "stop"
  }'
```

## Final Notes

- **Start small**: Begin with smaller position sizes until you're confident in the system
- **Monitor daily**: Check performance metrics and logs daily
- **Gradual scaling**: Increase capital allocation gradually as performance proves consistent
- **Regular updates**: Keep the system updated with `git pull` and redeploy

Remember that no trading strategy guarantees profits. Always monitor your system and be prepared to intervene if market conditions change dramatically.
